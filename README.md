# Arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the basic operations and functionalities of **Arrays** in the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures used in computer science, and this project aims to cover various array manipulation techniques, including:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Traversing

The code is written in **C++** to provide clear, step-by-step explanations and examples.

## Features

- **Array Insertion**: Demonstrates how to add elements at the end, in the middle, or at a specific index in an array.
- **Array Deletion**: Shows how to remove elements from an array by index or value.
- **Searching in Arrays**: Explores linear search and binary search algorithms to find elements in arrays.
- **Sorting Arrays**: Provides examples of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Traversing Arrays**: Iterates over array elements to perform operations such as printing or summing values.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler** (G++ or any modern C++ compiler)
- **Basic understanding of Arrays and Algorithms**
